== Description ==

This plugin identifies if a visitor is using Internet Explorer 6 (or older) and suggests to upgrade to a recent version or to install another web browser. 

**Info:**
If you have WP Super Cache or some other cache plugin installed it's very possible that Stop IE6 will not work properly. I'll try to fix that ASAP.

**Please take a few seconds of your time and rate this plugin. Thank you!**
